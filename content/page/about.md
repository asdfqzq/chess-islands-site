Chess Islands started as a demo project for teaching programming, and it soon became a much more involved, in-depth project. It is currently still in development, and has been in development for a few years. Expected to be released sometime in 2025 or 2026.

It is built primarily using Luau, Python, and Rust. Luau for everything on Roblox's end; Python for various miscellaneous data-processing tasks; Rust for servers running on AWS.
