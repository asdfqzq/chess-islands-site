Tutorials were previously only in 2D; now, they may also be viewed in 3D in the form of interactable islands. With the transition from UI to islands also comes additional effects and animations incorporated throughout the tutorial playthrough content.

Tutorials are available for each of the current 12 chess gamemodes, supplying in-depth explanations for each variant, as well as tips and tricks here and there.
